# Test plan and output
* Test plan is created by user defined input and we can verify by its output.

## HIGH LEVEL TEST PLAN

| Test ID | Description | Input | Expected output | Actual Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Performs Arthmetic Operations | User Defined| Based on Input |   found |
| 02 | Performs Trignometric Operations |User Defined | Based on Input |    Found   |
| 03 | Performs Different Operations  | User Defined| Based on Input   |    Found   |

## LOW LEVEL TEST PLAN

| Test ID | Description | Input | Expected output | Actual Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Peforms Addition | (3, 5) |8 | 8 |
| 02 | Peforms Subtraction| (5, 3) | 2 | 2 |
| 03 | Peforms Multiplication| (4, 3) | 12 | 12  |
| 04 | Peforms Division| (8, 4) | 2 | 2  |
| 05 | Peforms Modulus| (5, 2) | 1 | 1 |
| 06 | Peforms Sin | 90 |1 | 1  |
| 07 | Peforms Cos | 0 | 0 | 0  |
| 08 | Peforms Tan | 90 | Undefined | Undefined |
| 09 | Peforms Cosec | 45 | 1.41 | 1.41|
| 10 | Peforms Cot| 30 | 1.73 | 1.73 |
| 11 | Peforms Sec | 270 | Undefined |  Undefined |
| 12 | Peforms Squareoot | 81 | 9 | 9 |
| 13 |  Peforms Cuberoot | 27 | 3 | 3 |
| 14 |  Peforms Power  | (5^4) | 625 | 625 |
| 15 |  Peforms Squares| 20 | 400 | 400 |
| 16 |  Peforms  Cubes| 10 |1000| 1000 |
| 17 |  Peforms Log | 10 | 1 | 1 |
| 18 |  Peforms Factorial | 5 | 120 | 120 |

### Best Practices
  *  [x] Checked the output for user defined inputs.
  *  [x] Mentioned all the inputs for better understanding.
  *  [x] Presented in tabular form for easy understanding.
  *  [x] Both High level and low level Test plans are shown.
