## DESCRIPTION:
 * Caluculator is a machine which performs basic operations like addition, subtraction,           
   multiplication, division etc.
 * It is used to do mathematical operations.
 * They are two types of caluculators:
     1. Pocket Caluculator
     2. Scentific Caluculator
  ## Pocket Caluculator: 
          It is a small caluculator in which we can perform only basic arthmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.It is small in size.Most of the pocket caluculators are solar based.
  ## Scentific Caluculator:
          It can do more operations than pocket caluculator like trignometric functions,square and cube of a numbers, factorials etc.We can use bigger numbers in this caluculator.

## REQUIREMENTS:
  
  ## High level requirements:

  * We need two operands to perform operation.
  * We need specific operation to perform between operands.
  * We need another  variable to store that result.
 
  ## Low level requirements:
   
  * First we have to know the what are the operartions there in scentific caluculator.
  * We have to understand the logic to implement them in c programming language.
  * We have to understand the mathematical operations.

## 5W AND 1H:

 ## WHAT--
   Scentific Caluculator.
   It is a electronic machine.
   It performs specific operation given to it.

 ## WHY--
   It saves time while doing mathematical operations.
   It helps in solving the complex problems easily.

 ## WHEN--
   It used in maths exams.
   It used in tally accounts.

## WHERE--
   It can be used in general stores, super markets, schools, colleges etc

## WHO--
   This caluculators are used by students, shopkeepers to do caluculations.

## HOW--
   By using c programming.
   Using softwares like visual studiocode, github etc
   It takes input from users and perform operations.
