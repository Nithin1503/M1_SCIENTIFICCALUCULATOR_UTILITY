## DESCRIPTION:
 * Caluculator is a machine which performs basic operations like addition, subtraction,           
   multiplication, division etc.
 * It is used to do mathematical operations.
 * They are two types of caluculators:
     1. Pocket Caluculator
     2. Scientific Caluculator
  ## Pocket Caluculator: 
  It is a small caluculator in which we can perform only basic arthmetic operations like     addition,subtraction,multiplication, division.It is small in size.Most of the pocket caluculators are solar based.
  ## Scientific Caluculator:
  It can do more operations than pocket caluculator like trignometric functions,square and cube of a numbers,factorials etc.We can use bigger numbers in this caluculator.

## REQUIREMENTS:
  
  ## High level requirements:

  * We need two operands to perform operation.
  * We need specific operation to perform between operands.
  * We need another  variable to store that result.
 
  ## Low level requirements:
   
  * First we have to know the what are the operartions there in scentific caluculator.
  * We have to understand the logic to implement them in c programming language.
  * We have to understand the mathematical operations.

## 5W AND 1H:

 ## WHAT--
  * Scientific Caluculator.
  * It is a electronic machine.
  * It performs specific operation given to it.

 ## WHY--
  * It saves time while doing mathematical operations.
  * It helps in solving the complex problems easily.

 ## WHEN--
  * It used in maths exams.
  * It used in tally accounts.

## WHERE--
  * It can be used in general stores, super markets, schools, colleges etc

## WHO--
  * This caluculators are used by students, shopkeepers to do caluculations.

## HOW--
  * By using c programming.
  * Using softwares like visual studiocode, github etc
  * It takes input from users and perform operations.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

## STRENGTH
  * Easy to use.
  * Faster caluculations.
  * Helps students and shopkeepers in mathematical operations.

## WEAKNESS
  * Solar based.
  * No light facility.

## OPPURTUNITIES
  * Too many General stores, Medical shops, resturants, Hotels, Schools etc.
  * Large number of students and shopkeepers.

## THREAT
  * More advanced  mobile phones are used instead of caluculators.
