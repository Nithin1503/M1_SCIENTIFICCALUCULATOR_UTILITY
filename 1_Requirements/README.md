## DESCRIPTION:
 * Caluculator is a machine which performs basic operations like addition, subtraction,           
   multiplication, division etc.
 * It is used to do mathematical operations.
 * They are two types of caluculators:
    1. Pocket Caluculator
    2. Scientific Caluculator
     
  ## Pocket Caluculator: 
  * It is a small caluculator in which we can perform only basic arthmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
  * It is small in size.
  * Most of the pocket caluculators are solar based.
  
  ## Scientific Caluculator:
  * It can do more operations than pocket caluculator like trignometric functions, square and cube of a numbers, factorials etc.
  * We can use bigger numbers in this caluculator.

## 5W AND 1H:

 ## WHAT
 * Scientific Caluculator.
 * It is a electronic machine.
 * It performs specific operation given to it.

 ## WHY
 * It saves time while doing mathematical operations.
 * It helps in solving the complex problems easily.

 ## WHEN
 * It used in maths exams.
 * It used in tally accounts.

 ## WHERE
 * It can be used in general stores, super markets, schools, colleges etc

 ## WHO
 * This caluculators are used by students, shopkeepers to do caluculations.

 ## HOW
 * By using c programming.
 * Using softwares like visual studiocode, github etc
 * It takes input from users and perform operations.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

## STRENGTH
  * Easy to use.
  * Faster caluculations.
  * Helps students and shopkeepers in mathematical operations.

## WEAKNESS
  * Solar based.
  * No light facility.

## OPPURTUNITIES
  * Too many General stores, Medical shops, resturants, Hotels, Schools etc.
  * Large number of students and shopkeepers.

## THREAT
  * More advanced  mobile phones are used instead of caluculators.
